# 👋 Hi, I'm Imanol

**Engineer | From Code to Strategy & Beyond**

I’m a software engineer who believes that every line of code carries intention,  
and every system we build shapes the world we live in.

With a foundation in engineering, a Master’s in Marketing,  
and a growing passion for politics and critical thinking,  
I approach technology as both a tool and a language.

> **In the tech industry, we build the future.**  
> I believe that future should be meaningful, responsible, and beautifully made.
